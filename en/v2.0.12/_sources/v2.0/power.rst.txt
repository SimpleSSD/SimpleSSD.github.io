Power and Energy Model
**********************

In this page, we will explain how we design and implement power and energy model of hardware.


Embedded Core
=============

We used McPAT [1]_ library for estimating power and energy consumption of embedded core.
We modified McPAT (for windows support and interfacing SimpleSSD), you can download our version of McPAT :xref:`here <mcpat>`.

For McPAT interfacing, see ``SimpleSSD::CPU::CPU::calculatePower`` function defined in ``cpu/cpu.cc``.


DRAM
====

We used DRAMPower [2]_ library for DRAM power and energy consumption estimation.
As gem5 uses DRAMPower, you can find DRAMPower source at ``ext/drampower`` of SimpleSSD-FullSystem repository.
For standalone version, ``lib/drampower`` contains same DRAMPower with full system.

For DRAMPower interfacing, see ``SimpleSSD::DRAM::SimpleDRAM::read`` and ``write`` functions defined in ``dram/simple.cc``.


NAND flash array
================

As there is no NAND power estimation library, we created simple power/energy model for NAND flash based on NANDFlashSim [3]_.

From the NAND flash datasheet, we get current values that NAND flash consumes when idle or perform I/O operations.
These values are multiplied by die active time (at each state, which is collected by PAL statistics) to get energy consumption (of course, the voltage value also multiplied).
