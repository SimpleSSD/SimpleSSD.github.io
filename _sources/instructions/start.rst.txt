Getting Started

In this section, we will explain how to prepare SimpleSSD in step by step.


.. _start_fullsystem:

SimpleSSD-FullSystem
====================


Prerequisite
------------

Before downloading SimpleSSD-FullSystem, you should install dependencies.
As gem5 only supports Linux system, SimpleSSD-FullSystem does not supports other operating systems such as Windows or Mac OS.

.. code-block:: shell

  # For Debian based Linux
  apt install build-essentials
  apt install scons python-dev zlib1-dev m4 cmake
  apt install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
  apt install libgoogle-perftools-dev

  # For Red Hat based Linux
  yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
  yum install epel-release
  yum install scons python2-devel zlib-devel cmake
  yum install protobuf-devel google-perftools-devel


Download source code
--------------------

After installing libraries, clone GitHub repository and configure submodules.

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone git@github.com:simplessd/simplessd-fullsystem
  cd simplessd-fullsystem
  git checkout v2.0.1
  git submodule update --init --recursive


Build
-----

Build SimpleSSD-FullSystem using ``scons``.
SimpleSSD only supports ``ARM`` and ``X86`` architectures.

For more details on command line, check :xref:`gem5_build`.

.. code-block:: shell

  # For ARM architecture
  scons build/ARM/gem5.opt -j 8 --ignore-style

  # For X86 architecture
  scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j 8 --ignore-style


Prepare full system files
-------------------------

As we will boot gem5 in full system simulation mode, we need full system files such as Linux Kernel image and disk image.
If you want to download original gem5-provided full system files, visit :xref:`gem5_download`.
We recommend to download files from :xref:`here <camelab_files>`, because the files from gem5 does not support NVMe.
You don't need to download ``kernel_configs`` directory if you are not plan to build Linux Kernel on your own.

Create directory to store downloaded files and set ``M5_PATH`` environment variable points that directory.

.. code-block:: shell

  mkdir $HOME/m5
  export M5_PATH=$HOME/m5

Download files from the above link.
If you only downloaded files we provided, a directory tree should looks like:

.. code-block:: shell

  $M5_PATH
  ├─ binaries
  │ ├─ boot.arm
  │ ├─ boot_emm.arm
  │ ├─ boot_emm.arm64
  │ ├─ aarch64-vmlinux-4.9.92
  │ └─ x86_64-vmlinux-4.9.92
  └─ disks
    ├─ linaro-aarch64-linux.img
    └─ x86root


ARM specific stuff
------------------

We need to compile ``dtc`` files to create ``dtb`` files.
These file define hardware components (and its information) exist on current system.

Install a DeviceTree Compiler.

.. code-block:: shell

  # For Debian based Linux
  apt install device-tree-compiler

  # For Red Hat based Linux
  yum install dtc

You can find ``dtc`` files in ``system/arm/dt`` of SimpleSSD-FullSystem repository.

.. code-block:: shell

  cd system/arm/dt
  make

``make`` will generates ``dtb`` files for ``VExpress_GEM5_V1`` system of gem5.
Each file defines architecture (``armv7`` or ``armv8``) and the number of CPU in the system (1, 2, 4. 8 or 16).
Copy or move produced ``dtb`` to ``$M5_PATH/binaries``.

.. code-block:: shell

  mv *.dtb $HOME/m5/binaries

Now you are ready to execute SimpleSSD-FullSystem.
See :ref:`tutorial_basic_fullsystem` for running instructions.


.. _start_standalone:

SimpleSSD-Standalone
====================


Prerequisite
------------

Before downloading SimpleSSD-Standalone, you need C/C++ compiler which supports C++11 and ``<regex>``.
If you are on Windows, ``MSVC 2015`` or newer will work.
If you are on Linux system, ``gcc/g++ 4.9`` or newer will work.

SimpleSSD-Standalone uses ``cmake`` for build system.
If you prefer to use ``LLVM`` you may need to modify ``CMakeList.txt`` file.

Install ``cmake 3.10`` or newer. (> 2.8 may work.)


Download source code
--------------------

After installing ``cmake``, clone GitHub repository and configure submodules.

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone git@github.com:simplessd/simplessd-standalone
  cd simplessd-standalone
  git checkout v2.0-rc3
  git submodule update --init --recursive


Build
-----

Build SimpleSSD-Standalone using following command line.

.. code-block:: shell

  cmake -DDEBUG_BUILD=off .
  make -j 8

To build SimpleSSD-Standalone in debug mode, use ``-DDEBUG_BUILD=on``.
After successful build, you can find ``simplessd-standalone`` executable on current working directory.

Now you are ready to execute SimpleSSD-Standalone.
See :ref:`tutorial_basic_standalone` for running instructions.
