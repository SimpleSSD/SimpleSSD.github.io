Welcome to the SimpleSSD website.
SimpleSSD is a high-fidelity simulator that models all detailed characteristics of hardware and software, to build up a complete storage stack from scratch and simplify the nondescript features of storage internals.
In contrast to existing SSD simulators, it can accommodate a complete storage stack and evaluate the performance of SSDs along with diverse memory technologies and micro-architectures by integrating into publicly-available full system simulator (:xref:`gem5`).
Consequently, it allows system designers and architects to explore the full design space at different levels of system abstraction.
The SimpleSSD simulation model has been validated with a real devices.

You can download SimpleSSD from :doc:`./download`.
If you'd like to use the SimpleSSD simulator in your research, please cite our paper.
For convenience, here is the :doc:`./ack`.


Demo Video
